Day 25 of 100-day Python coding challenge

# U.S. States Game

This Python program is a simple game that quizzes the user on the names of the U.S. states. The user is prompted to enter the name of a state, and if it is correct, the state's name is displayed on a map. The game continues until the user exits or guesses all 50 states correctly.

## How it Works

1. The program reads state data from a CSV file containing the names and coordinates of U.S. states.
2. It displays a blank map of the U.S. states.
3. The user is prompted to enter the name of a state.
4. If the entered state name is correct, it is displayed on the map.
5. The game continues until the user exits or guesses all 50 states correctly.

## Features

- User input for guessing state names.
- Display of correct state names on a map.
- Track of the number of correct guesses.
- Exit option to end the game.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Turtle graphics library
- Pandas library

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas

```

4. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
